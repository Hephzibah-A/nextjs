# Next.js Learning Hub

Welcome to my personal Next.js learning hub! This repository is a collection of my notes and projects as I dive deeper into the world of Next.js.

I created this space to track my progress, document my understanding, and share my journey with others who are also learning this amazing framework.

### What's Inside?

-   **`/notes`**: My personal notes and summaries on Next.js concepts, from core fundamentals to advanced topics.
-   **`/projects`**: A showcase of mini-projects and larger applications I've built to apply my knowledge. Each project directory has its own `README.md` with details on its purpose, features, and technologies used.

### Technologies

* **Next.js**: The star of the show!
* **React**: The foundation for all things Next.js.
* **JavaScript/TypeScript**: The languages I'll be using.
